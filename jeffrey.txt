Hello there. I think that I have solved two recent issues.
The first was the FATAL ERROR for the feof, etc. functions.
The second was the extra tokens created at the EOLs.
The first was solved by reworking the while loop,
creating a token var outside of the loop, etc. Look at the code.
The second was solved by using rtrim() and removing \n\r because
fgets includes \n\r. The next task is to continue to work on the
message system. I want to loop through an array of tokens, printing
all important information.
